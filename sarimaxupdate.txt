Version 1.1

✅ 1. Outlier Smoothing via Z-Score
What it does:
Detects extreme spikes in sales using the Z-score method (threshold of ±3) and temporarily nulls them out. Those gaps are then filled using linear interpolation.

Why it matters:
Prevents one-off events or recording errors from distorting the SARIMAX forecast.

✅ 2. Missing Value Interpolation
What it does:
Backfills missing data using previous available values (bfill) and uses interpolation after removing outliers.

Why it matters:
Time series forecasting hates missing data. This ensures continuity while still respecting historical patterns.

✅ 3. Box-Cox Transformation (Toggleable)
What it does:
Optionally applies a Box-Cox transformation to stabilize variance (great for data with exponential trends). You can toggle it on/off in Streamlit.

Why it matters:
Improves model stationarity, especially helpful when forecasting machines with seasonal or exponential growth.

✅ 4. Dynamic Seasonal Period Detection
What it does:
Automatically sets the seasonal_period (the “m” in SARIMAX) based on the frequency selected:

Daily → 7 (weekly seasonality)

Weekly → 52 (yearly seasonality)

Monthly → 12

Quarterly → 4

Bi-annually → 2

Yearly → 1

Why it matters:
Tailors the SARIMAX model to fit your frequency choice, boosting forecast relevance and reducing overfitting.

✅ 5. Resampling Strategy (Sum vs Mean)
What it does:

Daily/Weekly data = sum (e.g. sales volume per day/week)

Monthly and above = mean (e.g. average monthly output)

Why it matters:
Prevents high-level periods from being bloated by summing across long timeframes.

✅ 6. Forecast Accuracy Metrics
What it does:
Calculates and displays:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – simple avg error

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – sensitive to large errors

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) – great for percentage-based benchmarks

Rolling MAE – trend-stability measure using lag-1 differences

Why it matters:
These metrics help you assess model quality and give stakeholders confidence in the forecast’s reliability.

✅ 7. Forecast Visualization & Export
Dual-line chart: historical + forecast

Forecast is plotted with a dashed line

Version 1.2

✅ 1. Outlier Smoothing via Z-Score
What it does:
Detects extreme spikes in sales using the Z-score method (threshold of ±3) and temporarily nulls them out. Those gaps are then filled using linear interpolation.

Why it matters:
Prevents one-off events or recording errors from distorting the SARIMAX forecast.

✅ 2. Missing Value Interpolation
What it does:
Backfills missing data using previous available values (bfill) and uses interpolation after removing outliers.

Why it matters:
Time series forecasting hates missing data. This ensures continuity while still respecting historical patterns.

✅ 3. Dynamic Seasonal Period Setting
What it does:
Customizes SARIMAX's seasonal period (`m` parameter) based on the selected frequency:

Daily → 30  
Weekly → 8  
Monthly → 3

Why it matters:
Reduces training time while maintaining useful periodicity. Prevents overfitting with shorter but meaningful seasonal cycles.

✅ 4. Forecast Limits
What it does:
Restricts maximum forecast window to roughly 3 months of forward predictions based on frequency:

- Daily → max 90 days  
- Weekly → max 12 weeks  
- Monthly → max 3 months

Why it matters:
Keeps forecasts practical and manageable for short-term decision-making.

✅ 5. Forecast Accuracy Metrics (Revamped Display)
What it does:
Displays four key metrics in a single horizontal row across full width:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Rolling Change (average percentage change between periods)

Why it matters:
Cleaner UI and clearer benchmarking of model performance.

✅ 6. Improved Forecast Chart
What it does:
Adds numeric data labels on top of each point (train, test, and forecast) with enlarged fonts for readability.

Why it matters:
Makes individual point comparisons easier during presentations or debugging.

✅ 7. A1 Machine Default
What it does:
Sorts all available machines alphabetically and auto-selects the first (e.g., A1).

Why it matters:
Ensures a consistent entry point for new users or when testing multiple models.

✅ 8. Streamlined Model Parameters
What it does:
SARIMAX is now initialized with:
- (1, 0, 0) non-seasonal order
- (1, 1, 1, m) seasonal order, based on frequency

Why it matters:
Stable baseline configuration suitable for most vending machine sales data.

✅ 9. CSV Export with Naming
What it does:
Exports the forecast with filename formatted as:
`[machineID]_[frequency]_sarimax_forecast.csv`

Why it matters:
Helpful for organizing exports when analyzing many locations or periods.
