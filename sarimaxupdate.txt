Version 1.1

✅ 1. Outlier Smoothing via Z-Score
What it does:
Detects extreme spikes in sales using the Z-score method (threshold of ±3) and temporarily nulls them out. Those gaps are then filled using linear interpolation.

Why it matters:
Prevents one-off events or recording errors from distorting the SARIMAX forecast.

✅ 2. Missing Value Interpolation
What it does:
Backfills missing data using previous available values (bfill) and uses interpolation after removing outliers.

Why it matters:
Time series forecasting hates missing data. This ensures continuity while still respecting historical patterns.

✅ 3. Box-Cox Transformation (Toggleable)
What it does:
Optionally applies a Box-Cox transformation to stabilize variance (great for data with exponential trends). You can toggle it on/off in Streamlit.

Why it matters:
Improves model stationarity, especially helpful when forecasting machines with seasonal or exponential growth.

✅ 4. Dynamic Seasonal Period Detection
What it does:
Automatically sets the seasonal_period (the “m” in SARIMAX) based on the frequency selected:

Daily → 7 (weekly seasonality)

Weekly → 52 (yearly seasonality)

Monthly → 12

Quarterly → 4

Bi-annually → 2

Yearly → 1

Why it matters:
Tailors the SARIMAX model to fit your frequency choice, boosting forecast relevance and reducing overfitting.

✅ 5. Resampling Strategy (Sum vs Mean)
What it does:

Daily/Weekly data = sum (e.g. sales volume per day/week)

Monthly and above = mean (e.g. average monthly output)

Why it matters:
Prevents high-level periods from being bloated by summing across long timeframes.

✅ 6. Forecast Accuracy Metrics
What it does:
Calculates and displays:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – simple avg error

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – sensitive to large errors

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) – great for percentage-based benchmarks

Rolling MAE – trend-stability measure using lag-1 differences

Why it matters:
These metrics help you assess model quality and give stakeholders confidence in the forecast’s reliability.
